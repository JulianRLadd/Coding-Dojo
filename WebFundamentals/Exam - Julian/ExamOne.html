                <p>
                    We offer a free collection serv'ice across the UK for the removal of your old IT systems. We safely reuse this
                    equipment by ensuring any sensitive or personal information that was on these machines is either physically
                    removed or destroyed before we reuse them. using us shall not only benefit the environment by avoiding the
                    waste and disposal of this equipment Out shall also help others, as we donate and propoflion of all the
                    equipment we collect.

                    The environmental and social
                    benefits of reuse do not only
                    help conserve natural
                    resources, Out help reduce air
                    and water pollution caused by
                    hazardous disposal. Reuse
                    reduces the amount of
                    greenhouse gas emissions
                    caused by the manufacturing
                    of new products. It simply
                    makes good sense to let us
                    collect and reuse your
                    equipment.
