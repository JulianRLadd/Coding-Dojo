            <h3>Character Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                Caliban Leandros is a 26 year old demi-mortal with a human half-brother. He is half-human, half-Auphe.
                Auphe are creatures with space dimensional abilties. They have claws, transparently pale skin, red eyes
                that see in infared, and a myriad of metallic teeth that resemble needles.
                While Caliban is human enough on the outside to pass the casual glance, on the inside he is something
                this world has never seen.
            </p>
            <p>
                The series of 12 books details
                the story of his life alongside his brother Niko as they fight for their life against things that go bump
                in the night. However, it seems they're slowly losing the battle against the monster within Caliban. Using 
                inherited abilties from his Auphe side, Cal can "gate" - that is, create rips in the spacial reality of the
                world that function as wormholes to anyplace he's been before or seen before.
